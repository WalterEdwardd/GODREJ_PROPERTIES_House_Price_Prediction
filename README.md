# GODREJ_PROPERTIES_House_Price_Prediction
Tools used: Power BI, Excel, Visual Studio Code

## Problem Statement
“A machine learning model is to be proposed to predict a house price based on data related to the house i.e., its area type, availability, location, size, society, total square feet, bath and balcony using Regression.”

## Goals of the Study
1.	To apply data preprocessing and preparation techniques in order to obtain clean data (EDA).
2.	To build machine learning models able to predict house price based on house features.
3.	To analyze and compare models performance in order to choose the best model.
